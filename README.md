# Chicago Weather and Crime

CS 210 final project. Looking at whether daily weather predicts daily crime in Chicago, 2018–2024.

**Final report:** `report/final_report.pdf`
**Demo video:** <<YouTube URL pending>>

---

## What's in here

- Two real public datasets (Chicago crime + NOAA O'Hare weather), cleaned and merged.
- A SQLite database with three tables and six demo SQL queries (JOIN, CASE WHEN, window function, CTE).
- EDA with three statistical tests and 9 figures.
- Four predictors compared: mean baseline, day-of-week mean baseline, Ridge regression, Random Forest.
- Per-category Random Forest models across all six crime types.
- TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation and a paired t-test on per-fold MAE.

## Setup

Python 3 (3.10+ tested; built on 3.13).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feruzkarimovv/chicago-weather-crime
cd chicago-weather-crime
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to reproduce

The first notebook downloads the raw data (the crime CSV is ~1.9 GB and takes a few minutes). After that, run the notebooks in order:

1. `notebooks/01_data_collection.ipynb` — download Chicago crime + NOAA weather
2. `notebooks/02_data_cleaning.ipynb` — clean both datasets, aggregate daily, merge
3. `notebooks/03_database_setup.ipynb` — build SQLite + run 6 SQL queries
4. `notebooks/04_eda.ipynb` — 9 figures + Welch t-test, ANOVA, Pearson
5. `notebooks/05_modeling.ipynb` — 4 models, CV, diagnostic figures, per-category
6. `notebooks/06_results.ipynb` — pulls everything together for the report

Or open them all at once:

```bash
jupyter lab notebooks/
```

## Data

- **Chicago crime** — City of Chicago Open Data Portal, *Crimes – 2001 to Present.*
- **Weather** — NOAA NCEI Global Historical Climatology Network – Daily, station USW00094846 (Chicago O'Hare).

Raw data is not committed (the crime CSV is ~1.9 GB). The first notebook downloads it.

## Results

| Model | Test MAE | Test R² |
|---|---|---|
| Mean baseline | 74.95 | -0.589 |
| Day-of-week mean | 75.19 | -0.571 |
| Ridge regression | 40.49 | 0.456 |
| Random Forest | **39.37** | **0.463** |

Random Forest beats both baselines by ~47% on test MAE. Weather features collectively contribute ~14% of permutation importance; the 7-day rolling crime average dominates at 62%. Per-category, battery (R² = 0.40) and theft (0.27) are weather-sensitive; burglary and narcotics largely aren't.
